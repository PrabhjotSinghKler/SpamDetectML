# Email Spam Detection with Naive Bayes Classifier  

This project implements an **email spam detection system** using a **Naive Bayes classifier**. It leverages machine learning techniques to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam), aiming to enhance email filtering systems for improved reliability and security.

## üîç Introduction  

Email spam is a persistent issue, disrupting user experiences and burdening email systems. This project addresses the inefficiencies of traditional spam filters by employing a machine learning-based approach to accurately detect and filter spam emails.  

---

## ‚ùì Problem Statement  

Traditional spam detection systems struggle to adapt to evolving spam patterns, leading to:  
- False positives: Legitimate emails marked as spam.  
- False negatives: Spam emails bypassing the filter.  

This project focuses on developing a robust model that minimizes false negatives, ensuring harmful content is effectively blocked.

## üìä Dataset  

The dataset used contains:  
- **5572 emails**  
  - 86.6% categorized as "ham."  
  - 13.4% categorized as "spam."  
- After preprocessing:  
  - Duplicate rows: 415 removed.  
  - Missing values: None detected.  
- Features extracted using **Bag-of-Words**.  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Removed duplicates and missing values.  
- Transformed categorical labels ("ham" ‚Üí 0, "spam" ‚Üí 1).  

### 2. Model Training  
- Split dataset: 75% training, 25% testing.  
- Model: **Naive Bayes classifier** with **CountVectorizer** for feature extraction.  

### 3. Evaluation Metrics  
- **Accuracy**  
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score**  
- **ROC-AUC Curve**  

---

## üìà Results  

- **Accuracy**: 98.85% on the test set.  
- **Recall**: 93.5% for spam detection, prioritizing the reduction of missed spam.  
- **Train ROC-AUC**: 98.33%  
- **Test ROC-AUC**: 96.61%  

These results validate the model's robustness and suitability for real-world email filtering systems.
